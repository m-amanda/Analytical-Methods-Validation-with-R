# Analytical-Methods-Validation-with-R
This project of website performs validation of analytical methods. The selectivity is evaluated in terms of matrix effect. The linearity of the method is confirmed by coefficient of determination, ANOVA to regression and lack of fit, residual graph, Levene homogeneity test, Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and Durbin-Watson test for auto correleted errors. The limits of detection and quantification are calculated by regression error of the calibration curve chose.

To future features will be expected to implement:
- Calculate LOD and LOQ by blanks error;
- Precision tests (simple RSD% calculation, ANOVA assessment, and compare with a standard method);
- Trueness tests (recovery, compare with a standard method, and bias).
